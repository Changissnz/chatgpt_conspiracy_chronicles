**The Janice Frontstroller Conspiracy**

Janice Frontstroller’s name never appeared in government payrolls, yet her signature kept surfacing in contracts tied to defense budgets, pharmaceutical trials, and housing projects. No photograph of her existed, only initials scrawled on procurement orders—*J.F.S.*—like a ghost threading through the ledgers.

The first person to notice was an accountant in Chicago, who spotted the same signature approving both a bridge repair and a biomedical grant issued years apart. When he raised questions, his office was firebombed overnight. The fire report called it a gas leak.

Digging deeper revealed that “Frontstroller” wasn’t a person at all, but a rotating identity worn by insiders across agencies. Whoever signed as her could unlock dormant funds, reroute equipment, or authorize land seizures without oversight. She was the perfect phantom administrator: invisible in life, undeniable in paperwork.

Journalists who tried to pin her down began tracing projects bearing her name. They found a trail of uncanny disasters: hospitals that stood empty yet consumed millions; housing blocks condemned before they opened; research programs that claimed to cure diseases but instead produced patents for private investors.

One whistleblower insisted Frontstroller’s origins went back to the Cold War, when bureaucrats created a false “liaison officer” to move money secretly into weapons development. Over time, the phantom survived, outlasting presidents, shifting agencies, becoming a mask anyone with clearance could wear.

The conspiracy broke open when a researcher leaked an internal memo—an invitation to a “Frontstroller Ceremony” at a luxury hotel. The invite listed no names, only titles: **The Auditor, The Liaison, The Widow, The Stroller**.

But when journalists arrived, the ballroom was empty, the lights humming, chairs arranged in concentric circles around a baby carriage covered in black velvet. Inside was a briefcase, sealed with wax, stamped *J.F.S.*.

Security cleared the room within minutes. Reporters’ footage was deleted on the spot. The briefcase was never seen again.

Today, whenever unexplained funds vanish or ghost projects appear, conspiracy forums mutter the same name: *Janice Frontstroller*. Some say she never existed. Others say she never died.

And a few believe she still signs off on budgets that decide who prospers, and who quietly disappears.

Do you want me to take these conspiracy stories and **weave them into a shared universe** (with recurring secret societies and overlapping clues), or keep each as its own standalone mystery?
